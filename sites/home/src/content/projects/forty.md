# Hugo Theme - Forty

Forty is a website theme that I ported to Hugo, a Go based Static Site Generator, and open sourced so anyone can contribute or fork the project for their own needs. The original theme was written by Html5Up.

I am no longer maintaining this project but it is still being used by Hugo users.
