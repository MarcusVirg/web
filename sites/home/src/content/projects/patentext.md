# Patentext

[Patentext](https://www.patentext.com) is a tool used by patent practitioners to increase their drafting speed 3x-5x using AI. Patentext uses an AI-native HITL-based workflow. We first understand the invention and map disclosure material to an internal data model to represent inventions in almost all technical fields. This workflow does not require the practitioners to be prompt engineers like many other "co-pilot" tools. Instead the user provides objects in our invention graph data model as topics and we prompt the LLM internally to output high quality, topical sections in the detailed description.
