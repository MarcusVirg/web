This is an open source project created by [Tanner Linsley](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley) as part of his amazing suite of open source tools. I recently contributed to the project by adding all new Svelte examples that were completely missing previously. I also fixed a few issues with peer dependencies by adding and testing compatibility with Svelte 4.

[Here is the release](https://github.com/TanStack/virtual/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.69) my contribution was inside of.
