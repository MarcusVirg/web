# Introduction

Hello there! I want to start by thanking you for checking out my blog. This blog will contain mostly Software Engineering topics but I also plan to write about other things that I enjoy like Movies/TV, video games, fashion, or basketball.

All of what I write will be based on my own understanding, options, and assumptions about the world. I am trying to improve my writing skills and plan to use this blog to do just that. Here's to hoping my content becomes less and less cringe and that you get some value out of it.

I also plan to micro-blog on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@marcusvirginia) so if you are interested in content from me, please give me a follow!
