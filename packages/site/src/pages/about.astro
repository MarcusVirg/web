				I'm Marcus Virginia. I build cool stuff with web technology.
			</h1>

			<p class="mt-6 text-base text-zinc-400 leading-7">
				I am a software engineer that specializes in building products with web
				technology. My main goal is to identify and solve problems that impact
				individuals and communities, with the ultimate aim of making the world a
				better place. Ideally, I can solve these problems with technology, making the
				products I work on more accessible, inclusive, and easy to use for everyone.
				<br />
				<br />
				I enjoy collaborating directly with users, stakeholders, and domain experts to
				ensure I am creating the solution that can make the most impact and actually creates
				value for those that use it. I am most passionate about building products and
				software that align with my values as well as allow me learn and grow professionally.
				<br />
				<br />
				I also love learning new technologies and try to stay up to date with the latest
				and greatest, despite the never ending churn of new tools and frameworks. Recently,
				I have been exploring the Web3 space and trying to figure out what kind of problems
				that technology can solve other than decentralized finance. I am also currently
				interested in things like WASM, Web Containers, PWAs, and Developer Experience
				just to name a few.
				<br />
				<br />
				When I am not writing software and building things, I enjoy traveling to different
				countries and change up my environment often. I am a lowkey foodie and enjoy trying
				different foods and cuisines. Japanese cuisine might be my favorite so far! I
				am into fashion as well, mostly in the minimalist and streetwear space.
				<br />
				<br />
				Like many other technologist, I also play video games. They are one of my favorite
				mediums for experiencing art and storytelling. The Witcher 3, God of War, Control,
				and the NBA 2k games are some of my favorites (NBA 2k stopped making good games
				after 2017 IMO).
				<br />
				<br />
				To stay in shape, basketball is my go to sport. I also try to get to the gym reguarly,
				emphasis on try.
