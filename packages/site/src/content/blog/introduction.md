# Introduction

Hello there! I want to start by thanking you for checking out my blog. This blog will contain mostly Software Engineering topics but I also plan to write about other things that I enjoy like Movies/TV, video games, fashion, or basketball.

All of what I write will be based upon my own understanding, options, and assumptions about the world.
