# Friction Log

| Item               | Value                                                                                                                                      |

| Who is doing this? | {name}                                                                                                                                     |

| Key                | ðŸ˜ƒ: Easy. Makes sense!<br />ðŸ¤”: Had to work a little bit to get past it, wasn't great.<br />ðŸ˜Ÿ: Would have given up if I didn't work here. |

## My experience completing {task_title_here}

1. simple description of task ({key_here})<br />
   Add more thoughts about task here.

2. another description that should just fit on one line. ({key_here})<br />
   Again add further narration here if necessary.

...add all other tasks

3. Finished!
